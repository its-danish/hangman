### Design

#### Colour Scheme
Body colour: A Dark Grey![#373638](https://placehold.it/15/373638/000000?text=+)<br>
Text colour: White ![#FFFFFF](https://placehold.it/15/FFFFFF/000000?text=+)<br> 
Game Board background colour: A light grey ![#868686](https://placehold.it/15/868686/000000?text=+)<br>
Header and Footer background: A shade of light red ![#9E5656](https://placehold.it/15/9E5656/000000?text=+)<br>

#### Typography
The headers on all pages throughout the Website are using the [Playfair Display SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display+SC) font while the main text is using the [Rokkitt](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rokkitt) font.

#### Imagery
No physical images will be used on the site. A Hangman image will be drawn with code by using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to display this on the HTML page.

#### Differences to Design

All features listed in the Structure Plane were implemented as per design.
A custom 404 page was added to the Website that contains an anchor link to allow the user to direct back to the home page if they try to access a page that is not available.

#### **Access Requirements**

GitHub Respoitory must be set to public for the live website to be displayed.

#### **Regression Testing**

All features previously tested while in development should be retested on the live Website.

#### **Assumptions and Dependencies**

Testing is dependent on website being live on GitHub pages.

#### **Out of Scope**

Only testing listed under High Level Test Cases will be performed as part of this test effort.

### Test Results

![Results](assets/test-results/test_results.jpg)<br>
Full test results can be found [here](assets/test-results/ms2_test_results.xlsx)<br>
Please note these results are a .xlsx file and will require excel, google docs or compatiable program to open the file.<br>
All tests passed.
Testing of custom 404 page was performed to ensure you could navigate back to the home page without needing to use the browser buttons.

### Issues and Resolutions to issues found during testing
* Email mailto link was broken due to a space between the mailto and email. This was found when running code through jshint.com and was fixed by removing the space.
* Clicking the 'Start Game' button after the first game had been played was stopping the board from resetting due to the reset functions being called from the event listener on the 'Play Again' button. This was fixed by hiding the start button (jQuery to set display = 'none') after the first game has been played so it could not be pressed.
* Reference error (type error) was being displayed on the console if a user tried to input a guess into the text box when a game was not active. This was resolved by setting the gameFinish variable to true when declaring it as the game only validates input while the game is active.
* Replaced code in validateForm() form method that gets the input (guess) value to use dotnet notation to fix error shown in jshint validator.

## Deployment

### Project Creation
To create this project I initialised the repository by typing the following command into the bash terminal in Visual studio code:
* git init

For the initial commit I clicked on the Source Control menu on the side bar in Visual Studio code. Added the change to the staging area by clicking the '+' icon next to the file name. I then added a commit message in the text box below source control. Lastly I clicked on the Public to GitHub icon in the bottom left hand side of Visual Studio Code and I was then prompted with the following two options:
    
    * Publish to GitHub private repository
    * Public to GitHub public repository

I selected publish to GitHub public repository and my first commit was published.

The following commands were used for version control throughout the project:
* git add filename - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.
* git commit -m "commit message explaining the updates" - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository.
* git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.

### Using Github Pages

## Credits

### Code
The JavaScript hangman game was created by following a tutorial on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/). This was then heavily modified to fit the game design, including but not limited to: Use of jQuery to change CSS and HTML properties, increase hangman size, add face to hangman, keep a game score, user initiated game play, text input, letter validation (regex and conditional statements), layout change from flex to use bootstrap, use of arrays for words and hints.

### Acknowledgements
I would like to thank slack user Charlie for her support and UX Design pointers throughout this project.
